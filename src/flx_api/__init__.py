"""FLX REST API package initialization.

This package provides the RESTful API interface for the FLX Meltano Enterprise platform
using FastAPI framework. It serves as the primary programmatic interface for external
clients and services to interact with FLX functionality, including:

- Pipeline management and orchestration
- Plugin configuration and lifecycle management
- Authentication and authorization services
- Real-time monitoring and metrics
- WebSocket support for live updates
- Integration with the FLX core domain services

The API follows RESTful principles and provides automatic API documentation through
FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI (Swagger) and ReDoc interfaces.
